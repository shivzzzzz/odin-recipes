<h2>Karaage</h2>

<p>Kara-age is one of my favourite Japanese dishes and can be found on izakaya menus everywhere. A flavourful soy-based marinade sits underneath a very light flour coating which gives the dish it's name. Kara-age means “empty fry” or “naked fry” which refers to the chicken being fried without a thick batter. Frying the chicken in three short blasts at high heat with rests in between produces a crispy outer coating, while the inside cooks gently from residual heat for tender and succulent meat.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>600g chicken thighs, skin-on</li>
    <li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sake</li>
    <li>1 tbsp grated ginger, juice only</li>
    <li>½ tsp sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup potato flour (or substitute cornflour)</li>
    <li>about 2L canola, sunflower or other vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
    <li>Japanese mayonnaise, to serve</li>
    <li>lemon slices, to serve</li>
    <li>shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven-spice), to serve (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Cut the chicken into 5cm pieces. Combine the chicken with the soy sauce, sake, ginger juice and sugar and stand for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place the flour in a tray or large bowl. Pull the chicken out of the marinade with chopsticks and drop it into the flour, one piece at a time. Adding the pieces one at a time stops you from pouring in too much of the marinade, and stops the chicken from sticking together. Shake any excess flour from the chicken and place in a tray in a single layer. Allow the floured chicken to stand, uncovered for at least 5 minutes before frying.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil to 180°C in a wide saucepan. Add the chicken to the oil in batches. For each batch, deep fry for 1 minute then remove the chicken to a rack and rest for 30 seconds. Return the chicken back to the oil and fry for 30 seconds, and then rest on a rack again for 30 seconds. Transfer the chicken back into the oil for one last blast of 30 seconds to a minute, and then rest for a two minutes on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>Serve the chicken with a lemon wedge, and a little Japanese mayonnaise scattered with shichimi togarashi (if using).</li>
